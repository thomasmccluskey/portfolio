    <p class = assignment1-body-text> In John Berger's <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, he revolves what he talks about around European paintings. He discusses the authenticity
    of paintings, and how the invention of the camera took a toll on the value of painting. He makes a point on that the original <em>
    Starry Night</em> painting by Van Gogh has a greater value than a photograph or even a print of the same painting as the 
    impressiveness of the original painting holds a greater value. It's one of a kind. The invention of the camera has changed everyone's
perception of the worlds around them, and how much meaning people put on certain things. With the evolution of technology from photography to 
methods of 3D Scanning, 3D Modeling, Photogrammetry, etc. I wonder how the perception of the world around us will change compared to today.
